to my apartment and it's always filled with people whenever I walk by. One late night walking from the train stop back to my place, I succumbed to the allure of Upside Pizza and gave it a shot!","Inside was a super old school tiled pizzeria decor. The staff working there was super nice and was happy to introduce their favorite slices (mushroom!) and their signature sourdough bread. I opted in for the pepperoni corner slice, and they popped it into the oven to heat up.","I took the pizza to go and was excited to dive into it once I got back. My first impression was that the slice was ginormous up close, not only in length and width but also in height.","When I took a bite, I was first hit by the saltiness and char of the peps. There was a thick layer of cheese but was unfortunately not melted and a bit chewy. My favorite part of the slice was the bread. It was fluffy like a focaccia with a slight char on the bottom, giving the pizza a crunch in every bite. The sourdough was subtle, and the acidity was welcome in cutting through the saltiness of the pizza. I was surprised that pizza was not as greasy as I expected, and the bread played a big role in making the slice light.","I'm a big fan of tomato sauce on pizza and was looking for it in the slice but failed to find much, potentially due to the fact the slice was dried out from sitting out and reheated. There was also a little too much char for me, with some parts of the crust, peps, and cheese tasting burnt and a bit too bitter for my taste.","Overall, I respected the idea of Upside and their sourdough endeavors, but the reheated slice makes it hard to compare to the other great Sicilian slices in New York. I definitely would want to try a fresh slice right out of the oven, I'm sure that would be delicious.

The restaurant has a rustic atmosphere inside, combining farmhouse and club vibes in a dimly lit space. As claimed on their website, their dining room features 'salvaged and reclaimed equipment', and our abstract log-shaped table reflected that.","The first time I went, I don't remember much except that the crab toast was excellent and the ravioli I had was light and delicious. I'll write about my most recent trip to ABC kitchen.","We started with the Peekytoe crab toast with lemon aioli, which was delicious. There was lots of fresh crab, which provided a fresh slightly sweetness and deep crab flavor. The crab was mixed with fresh herbs and the aioli provided just the right amount of creaminess to bring the crab together. The toast provided a great crunch and added substance to the crab. Fresh lemon on top provided just the right acidity to cut through everything. This was probably one of the best pieces of toast I've had.","For the main, I ordered fried organic chicken, rainbow swiss chard habanero hot sauce butter. The dish looked stunning with a golden crust, but I was a bit disappointed with the dish. The chicken was made out of chicken breast, which made me feel healthy eating fried chicken but was not the main purpose of this meal. The chicken breast was juicy, but its low fat content and awkward crust to meat ratio made me want chicken thigh. In terms of flavor, the habanero hot sauce butter was good, but I wanted more bang (spice) and more sauce. The swiss chard tasted great, but it was another vehicle for the sauce in the dish. Maybe fried chicken wasn't the right thing to order here, but the price and the abundance of so much great fried chicken cause this dish to lose some points.","For dessert, we shared the cookie plate among 3 people, which had: cherry blossom sable\u2019, caramel swirl brownie, snickerdoodle, brown butter chocolate chip, oatmeal sandwich cookie. My friends are big cookie fans, and the cookie plate was a great selection to try out different flavors and satisfy their craving. The standouts were the soft brownie, the snickerdoodle, and the oatmeal sandwich with its marshmellow filling. A minor nitpick is that the cookies would be better if they were toasted quickly, but was a great way to end our meal.","Overall, I think ABC Kitchen has a great take on fresh farm-to-table American food. For me, it falls into a few of the common pitfalls of American food of not having enough flavor or being expensive. But I would be willing to give it another shot and maybe order like 5 crab toasts (jkjk).

I grew up eating a lot of scallion pancake, but this appetizer was unlike what I\u2019ve had before. Each piece was light and air and went well ricotta spread, which tasted like a cream cheese seasoned with roasted garlic, sesame, and hints of acidity.

I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome\u2019s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I\u2019ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef\u2019s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying. Each piece comes seasoned with hoisin sauce, but the extra chili and scallion/ginger sauce brighten up the pork.","The side salad came with greens, toasted walnuts, surprisingly lychee, and a sweet dressing. Each element worked well together. The brightness and sweetness from the salad were very welcome with the heaviness of the pork.

","Cote\u2019s covid measures have been the nicest I\u2019ve seen in a restaurant. We made a reservation for an outdoor cabana, a wooden room that we didn\u2019t have to share with other parties. The cabana could easily fit 4 people and was extremely spacious for our party of 2. Hand sanitizer was provided and we were given a mask bag that we got to keep. A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. ","We ordered the butcher\u2019s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.","The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.","The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.","The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn\u2019t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.","We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it\u2019s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.","To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out.

The savory pork was balanced by the fresh toppings of sweet pineapple, radish, onions, and cilantro. The tacos also came with some dried chili peppers that added some much-appreciated heat. The tortillas also were slightly charred and made the corn tortilla more fragrant. It could be because of the delivery, but I didn't taste any charred bits of the pork or any fatty parts of the Adobada.","The Quesadilla was the same meat and tortilla as the taco but came with some melted high-quality Monterrey cheese. It tasted great and is worth trying, but is pricy.","Just like the Adobada, there was a lot of steak in the Carne Asada Taco. The flavors on the beef were good, but the steak tasted pretty tough to me. I did enjoy the green sauce, which was creamy from the avocado while still retaining the classic salsa verde tomatillo freshness and flavors.","Overall, the meats and their flavors were high quality at Los Tacos but were missing some of the great taco meat flavors I was looking for in a great taco while being more expensive.

All the meats are cooked on the grill, and I love coming as one batch is finished cooking and I can get it as fresh as possible.","One of my favorite meats is the chorizo, a spiced ground sausage that's packed with flavor and slightly greasy. The steak is also tender and flavorful, with a char from the grill. The carnitas is amazingly tender and falls apart like pulled pork, but with fatty bits interspersed. I also really like the fajitas, with its mix of flavorful falling apart peppers, tender pieces of pork, and cheese. I've also tried their meats like chicken, barbacoa, and more, and all of them have been delicious.","The final part of the taco is the topping bar. There are all sorts of fresh salsas, with my favorite being the salsa verde with its creamy avocado and fresh tomatillo blend. They also have pico de gallo, a SUPER spicy orange salsa, and a few others. The fresh toppings of onions, cilantro, and lime also help bring lightness to a heavy taco and complete the taco experience. My only complaint is that I've noticed the cilantro not be fresh towards the end of the day with black spots, so be careful!","Las Palmas is a true hidden gem in Pittsburgh, and I've been going ever since my housemates recommended it to me.

The salsa verde on the side also has a deep roasted tomatillo flavor and brings some much-needed spice to the burrito.

And the best is at Rubirosa Ristorante, an amazing Italian restaurant nestled in Nolita. Inside has a cozy Italian home vibe, but I've only dined outside. They have a great covid setup, complete with wood booths, heat lamps above, hand sanitizers, and plastic dividers. ","When I think of Rubirosa, what comes to mind is their tomato sauce. They're able to get a deep umami flavor out of their tomatoes, making the sauce almost taste meaty but without any meat. At the same time, the acidity and the sweetness from the tomatoes bring brightness to anything the sauce touches.","An essential starter to Rubirosa is the calamari. The squid is lightly fried, with the crust almost flaking off but also providing an amazing crunch. The squid itself is tender and goes great with the lemon and chopped basil on top. The real magic is when the calamari is dipped in the tomato sauce, joining the umami of the squid and tomatoes along with the acidity from the lemon and the sauce. The sauce fills all the crevices of the breading and creates a tomato sauce gusher that explodes with flavor. The sauce also has a slight spicy kick, adding another dimension of flavor. A pro-tip is to ask for more sauce after you finish! We usually finish the sauce halfway through the calamari because it's so good.","The pizza at Rubirosa is one of a kind, best enjoyed piping hot right out of the oven. The pizza has an insanely crispy crust that has almost a cracker-like texture, and the crust's slight char adds a smoky dimension to the pizza. The crunchy-ness of the crust contrasts the melty fresh mozzarella on top and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the tomato sauce. Their cheese is milky and has its own slightly chewy texture, bringing together the tomato and the crust. Enjoying it right way ensures the maximum crispness of the crust, meltiness of the cheese, and flavors of the tomato sauce. And it's worth it burning the roof of my mouth over.","The foundation of the pizza is already delicious, but the toppings bring it to another level. The move is definitely to get half and half of two pizzas to try more flavors.","My favorite flavor is the Rubirosa Supreme, with mini meatballs, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and chopped basil. Even though I love meat on pizza, the best part for me is the roast garlic. The garlic is roasted until it's super soft, and it melts almost like garlic butter. Even though it's a clove of garlic, the garlic flavors are muted and not overwhemling. It adds a layer of creaminess and flavor that ties together the meat, tomatoes, cheese, and crust. The meats themselves are flavorful and high quality, as shown by the pepperonis curling into tiny cups.","I've been to Rubirosa probably around 5 times and I probably could make an album on my phone for it. The first time I had Rubirosa was delivery, which was average and the flavors were muted.

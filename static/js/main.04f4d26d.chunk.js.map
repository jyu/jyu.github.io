I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?).

The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.\",\n      \"The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.\",\n      \"The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn’t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.\",\n      \"We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it’s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.\",\n      \"To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out.

It was a 5 min walk from our Airbnb and we always saw aunties and uncles eating there, so it was only natural for us to try their Singaporean breakfast.\",\n      \"At around $4, we got a soft-boiled egg, kaya toast, and iced coffee. The egg came raw with a pail of boiling water. The auntie there walked us through what time mapped to what consistency on the eggs, and recommended us to try some light soy sauce and pepper on top. The kaya toast came with two pieces of toast with a light coconut jam in the middle. Dipped in the soft-boiled egg and soy sauce, the toast was an incredible combination of sweet, savory, and creaminess.\",\n      \"What tied the breakfast together was the iced coffee, which was a godsend under the Singaporean sun. The caffeine was much needed as we were still a little jetlagged, and the bitterness helped counterbalance the strong flavors of the toast.\",\n      \"Singaporean breakfast isn’t unique to Food Loft, but these ingredients go together so well and is a testament to Singaporean food culture. We went back to Food Loft a couple more times during our stay as it was so convenient for us. On almost every street corner in our neighborhood, we saw food courts and gems like Food Loft inside.

I’ve written about this in other posts, but the combination of seafood and meat umami is one of my favorite flavor combinations.\",\n      \"Our first main was slowly roasted Dingley Dell pork belly with apple puree and mustard. The pork belly skin was crispy and the meat fell apart with a fork. It was an interesting flavor combination with the sweet and sour apple sauce, but it was a little too sweet for me.\",\n      \"The star of our meal was the Beed Wellington, Gordon Ramsay’s signature dish. Inside was a medium-rare beef fillet steak, smothered with a layer of mushroom duxelle and wrapped in parma ham. Surrounding the whole thing was a flaky pastry shell, and was served with a red wine beef jus and roasted vegetables. Wow, this was probably the best steak I’ve had. The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. And the umami components of mushroom, parma, jus, and steak blended together to form a deep umami flavor bomb.  Wrapped everything was the many layers of the pastry, soaking up all the meaty flavor and forming the ultimate meat pastry.\",\n      \"Bread Street Kitchen was one of the first “fancy” restaurants I’ve been to and the food (and price) lived up to the hype!

My\n            dad told me stories about growing up in China on rations for rice,\n            protein, and vegetables. One story stands out in particular where\n            his family traded away their cigarette rations for more egg rations\n            to have more protein.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            My mom has always pushed me to think critically about what I eat,\n            quizzing me about what ingredients are behind a certain dish. In our\n            Shanghainese family, the ultimate metric for a dish was the Chinese\n            word 鲜 or xiān. The character 鲜 is made up of the Chinese\n            characters of a fish and lamb, two proteins held in high regard in\n            Chinese cuisine. The best way I can describe it is the deepness in\n            flavor, closest to umami. 鲜 is something we always are chasing when\n            eating, and it’s what separates the best food from the rest.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            I really enjoy traveling and learning about new and different food\n            cultures.

I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying.

We made a reservation for an outdoor cabana, a wooden room that we didn’t have to share with other parties. The cabana could easily fit 4 people and was extremely spacious for our party of 2. Hand sanitizer was provided and we were given a mask bag that we got to keep. A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. \",\n      \"We ordered the butcher’s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.\",\n      \"The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.\",\n      \"The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.\",\n      \"The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn’t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.\",\n      \"We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it’s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.\",\n      \"To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal.

What cuts through all the heaviness is the pico de gallo, with fresh pieces of tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and lime. The salsa verde on the side also has a deep roasted tomatillo flavor and brings some much-needed spice to the burrito. The owner has a strong preference that rice doesn't belong in burritos, and I have to agree when the lack of rice makes more room for so many of the other high-quality ingredients inside. \",\n      \"What brings the burrito together is the flour tortilla. An important tip for ordering is to ask for the burrito grilled, which transforms the tortilla into a crispy golden shell. The outer layers of the tortilla add an element of crunch, while the inner layers are soft and steamed. The tortilla is the perfect delivery mechanism for everything inside.\",\n      \"What makes La Tacqueria special is that each ingredient stands out on its own, and the union of everything together is perfectly balanced and truly amazing. When I was living in Mission, it was always special to bring people to try La Tacqueria and see their entire perception of burritos change.

And the best is at Rubirosa Ristorante, an amazing Italian restaurant nestled in Nolita. Inside has a cozy Italian home vibe, but I've only dined outside. They have a great covid setup, complete with wood booths, heat lamps above, hand sanitizers, and plastic dividers. \",\n      \"When I think of Rubirosa, what comes to mind is their tomato sauce. They're able to get a deep umami flavor out of their tomatoes, making the sauce almost taste meaty but without any meat. At the same time, the acidity and the sweetness from the tomatoes bring brightness to anything the sauce touches.\",\n      \"An essential starter to Rubirosa is the calamari. The squid is lightly fried, with the crust almost flaking off but also providing an amazing crunch. The squid itself is tender and goes great with the lemon and chopped basil on top. The real magic is when the calamari is dipped in the tomato sauce, joining the umami of the squid and tomatoes along with the acidity from the lemon and the sauce. The sauce fills all the crevices of the breading and creates a tomato sauce gusher that explodes with flavor. The sauce also has a slight spicy kick, adding another dimension of flavor. A pro-tip is to ask for more sauce after you finish! We usually finish the sauce halfway through the calamari because it's so good.\",\n      \"The pizza at Rubirosa is one of a kind, best enjoyed piping hot right out of the oven. The pizza has an insanely crispy crust that has almost a cracker-like texture, and the crust's slight char adds a smoky dimension to the pizza. The crunchy-ness of the crust contrasts the melty fresh mozzarella on top and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the tomato sauce. Their cheese is milky and has its own slightly chewy texture, bringing together the tomato and the crust. Enjoying it right way ensures the maximum crispness of the crust, meltiness of the cheese, and flavors of the tomato sauce. And it's worth it burning the roof of my mouth over.\",\n      \"The foundation of the pizza is already delicious, but the toppings bring it to another level. The move is definitely to get half and half of two pizzas to try more flavors.\",\n      \"My favorite flavor is the Rubirosa Supreme, with mini meatballs, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and chopped basil. Even though I love meat on pizza, the best part for me is the roast garlic. The garlic is roasted until it's super soft, and it melts almost like garlic butter. Even though it's a clove of garlic, the garlic flavors are muted and not overwhemling. It adds a layer of creaminess and flavor that ties together the meat, tomatoes, cheese, and crust. The meats themselves are flavorful and high quality, as shown by the pepperonis curling into tiny cups.\",\n      \"I've been to Rubirosa probably around 5 times and I probably could make an album on my phone for it. The first time I had Rubirosa was delivery, which was average and the flavors were muted. So definitely go in person, having the pizza right away is the way to go!\",\n      \"I'd recommend Rubirosa to anyone who wants to eat pizza in NYC!

My\n            dad told me stories about growing up in China on rations for rice,\n            protein, and vegetables. One story stands out in particular where\n            his family traded away their cigarette rations for more egg rations\n            to have more protein.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            My mom has always pushed me to think critically about what I eat,\n            quizzing me about what ingredients are behind a certain dish. In our\n            Shanghainese family, the ultimate metric for a dish was the Chinese\n            word 鲜 or xiān. The character 鲜 is made up of the Chinese\n            characters of a fish and lamb, two proteins held in high regard in\n            Chinese cuisine. The best way I can describe it is the deepness in\n            flavor, closest to umami. 鲜 is something we always are chasing when\n            eating, and it’s what separates the best food from the rest.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            I really enjoy traveling and learning about new and different food\n            cultures. I realized recipes we cook today are built on thousands of\n            years of collective human food knowledge. I see documenting\n            delicious meals as a way to share its cultures to a tiny corner of\n            the internet and as a small way to give back to the cultures behind\n            them.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading my ramblings.

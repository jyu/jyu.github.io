to my apartment and it's always filled with people whenever I walk by. One late night walking from the train stop back to my place, I succumbed to the allure of Upside Pizza and gave it a shot!","Inside was a super old school tiled pizzeria decor. The staff working there was super nice and was happy to introduce their favorite slices (mushroom!) and their signature sourdough bread. I opted in for the pepperoni corner slice, and they popped it into the oven to heat up.","I took the pizza to go and was excited to dive into it once I got back. My first impression was that the slice was ginormous up close, not only in length and width but also in height.","When I took a bite, I was first hit by the saltiness and char of the peps. There was a thick layer of cheese but was unfortunately not melted and a bit chewy. My favorite part of the slice was the bread. It was fluffy like a focaccia with a slight char on the bottom, giving the pizza a crunch in every bite. The sourdough was subtle, and the acidity was welcome in cutting through the saltiness of the pizza. I was surprised that pizza was not as greasy as I expected, and the bread played a big role in making the slice light.","I'm a big fan of tomato sauce on pizza and was looking for it in the slice but failed to find much, potentially due to the fact the slice was dried out from sitting out and reheated. There was also a little too much char for me, with some parts of the crust, peps, and cheese tasting burnt and a bit too bitter for my taste.","Overall, I respected the idea of Upside and their sourdough endeavors, but the reheated slice makes it hard to compare to the other great Sicilian slices in New York. I definitely would want to try a fresh slice right out of the oven, I'm sure that would be delicious.

As claimed on their website, their dining room features 'salvaged and reclaimed equipment', and our abstract log-shaped table reflected that.","The first time I went, I don't remember much except that the crab toast was excellent and the ravioli I had was light and delicious. I'll write about my most recent trip to ABC kitchen.","We started with the Peekytoe crab toast with lemon aioli, which was delicious. There was lots of fresh crab, which provided a fresh slightly sweetness and deep crab flavor. The crab was mixed with fresh herbs and the aioli provided just the right amount of creaminess to bring the crab together. The toast provided a great crunch and added substance to the crab. Fresh lemon on top provided just the right acidity to cut through everything. This was probably one of the best pieces of toast I've had.","For the main, I ordered fried organic chicken, rainbow swiss chard habanero hot sauce butter. The dish looked stunning with a golden crust, but I was a bit disappointed with the dish. The chicken was made out of chicken breast, which made me feel healthy eating fried chicken but was not the main purpose of this meal. The chicken breast was juicy, but its low fat content and awkward crust to meat ratio made me want chicken thigh. In terms of flavor, the habanero hot sauce butter was good, but I wanted more bang (spice) and more sauce. The swiss chard tasted great, but it was another vehicle for the sauce in the dish. Maybe fried chicken wasn't the right thing to order here, but the price and the abundance of so much great fried chicken cause this dish to lose some points.","For dessert, we shared the cookie plate among 3 people, which had: cherry blossom sable\u2019, caramel swirl brownie, snickerdoodle, brown butter chocolate chip, oatmeal sandwich cookie. My friends are big cookie fans, and the cookie plate was a great selection to try out different flavors and satisfy their craving. The standouts were the soft brownie, the snickerdoodle, and the oatmeal sandwich with its marshmellow filling. A minor nitpick is that the cookies would be better if they were toasted quickly, but was a great way to end our meal.","Overall, I think ABC Kitchen has a great take on fresh farm-to-table American food.

The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin.

The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.","The star of the meal for me was the banchan.

My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.","The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque.

Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out.

They're able to get a deep umami flavor out of their tomatoes, making the sauce almost taste meaty but without any meat. At the same time, the acidity and the sweetness from the tomatoes bring brightness to anything the sauce touches.","An essential starter to Rubirosa is the calamari. The squid is lightly fried, with the crust almost flaking off but also providing an amazing crunch. The squid itself is tender and goes great with the lemon and chopped basil on top. The real magic is when the calamari is dipped in the tomato sauce, joining the umami of the squid and tomatoes along with the acidity from the lemon and the sauce. The sauce fills all the crevices of the breading and creates a tomato sauce gusher that explodes with flavor. The sauce also has a slight spicy kick, adding another dimension of flavor. A pro-tip is to ask for more sauce after you finish! We usually finish the sauce halfway through the calamari because it's so good.","The pizza at Rubirosa is one of a kind, best enjoyed piping hot right out of the oven. The pizza has an insanely crispy crust that has almost a cracker-like texture, and the crust's slight char adds a smoky dimension to the pizza. The crunchy-ness of the crust contrasts the melty fresh mozzarella on top and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the tomato sauce. Their cheese is milky and has its own slightly chewy texture, bringing together the tomato and the crust. Enjoying it right way ensures the maximum crispness of the crust, meltiness of the cheese, and flavors of the tomato sauce.

The move is definitely to get half and half of two pizzas to try more flavors.","My favorite flavor is the Rubirosa Supreme, with mini meatballs, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and chopped basil. Even though I love meat on pizza, the best part for me is the roast garlic. The garlic is roasted until it's super soft, and it melts almost like garlic butter. Even though it's a clove of garlic, the garlic flavors are muted and not overwhemling. It adds a layer of creaminess and flavor that ties together the meat, tomatoes, cheese, and crust.

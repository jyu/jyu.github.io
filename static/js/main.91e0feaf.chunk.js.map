I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?).

My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.\",\n      \"The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.\",\n      \"The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi).

They have a great covid setup, complete with wood booths, heat lamps above, hand sanitizers, and plastic dividers. \",\n      \"When I think of Rubirosa, what comes to mind is their tomato sauce. They're able to get a deep umami flavor out of their tomatoes, making the sauce almost taste meaty but without any meat. At the same time, the acidity and the sweetness from the tomatoes bring brightness to anything the sauce touches.\",\n      \"An essential starter to Rubirosa is the calamari. The squid is lightly fried, with the crust almost flaking off but also providing an amazing crunch. The squid itself is tender and goes great with the lemon and chopped basil on top. The real magic is when the calamari is dipped in the tomato sauce, joining the umami of the squid and tomatoes along with the acidity from the lemon and the sauce. The sauce fills all the crevices of the breading and creates a tomato sauce gusher that explodes with flavor. The sauce also has a slight spicy kick, adding another dimension of flavor. A pro-tip is to ask for more sauce after you finish! We usually finish the sauce halfway through the calamari because it's so good.\",\n      \"The pizza at Rubirosa is one of a kind, best enjoyed piping hot right out of the oven. The pizza has an insanely crispy crust that has almost a cracker-like texture, and the crust's slight char adds a smoky dimension to the pizza. The crunchy-ness of the crust contrasts the melty fresh mozzarella on top and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the tomato sauce. Their cheese is milky and has its own slightly chewy texture, bringing together the tomato and the crust. Enjoying it right way ensures the maximum crispness of the crust, meltiness of the cheese, and flavors of the tomato sauce.

Even though I love meat on pizza, the best part for me is the roast garlic. The garlic is roasted until it's super soft, and it melts almost like garlic butter. Even though it's a clove of garlic, the garlic flavors are muted and not overwhemling. It adds a layer of creaminess and flavor that ties together the meat, tomatoes, cheese, and crust.

In our\n            Shanghainese family, the ultimate metric for a dish was the Chinese\n            word 鲜 or xiān. The character 鲜 is made up of the Chinese\n            characters of a fish and lamb, two proteins held in high regard in\n            Chinese cuisine. The best way I can describe it is the deepness in\n            flavor, closest to umami. 鲜 is something we always are chasing when\n            eating, and it’s what separates the best food from the rest.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            I really enjoy traveling and learning about new and different food\n            cultures. I realized recipes we cook today are built on thousands of\n            years of collective human food knowledge. I see documenting\n            delicious meals as a way to share its cultures to a tiny corner of\n            the internet and as a small way to give back to the cultures behind\n            them.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading my ramblings.

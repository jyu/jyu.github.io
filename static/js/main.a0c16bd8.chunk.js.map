And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. \",\n      \"I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a much different experience compared to the pad thai I’ve had in the US.\",\n      \"I’m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand.

The crab is sourced from the province of Surat Thani in Southern Thailand and had an incredibly sweet yet umami flavor. The crab is further amplified by the powerful spices and chilis in the curry. And in return, the curry inherits the deep crab flavor. The curry also came with Cha Plu leaves, which are part of the peppercorn family and counterbalanced the heaviness of the crab.\",\n      \"I also enjoyed Moo Cha Muang, which was pieces of roast pork jammed with a spicy and sweet curry.

I grew up eating a lot of scallion pancake, but this appetizer was unlike what I’ve had before. Each piece was light and air and went well ricotta spread, which tasted like a cream cheese seasoned with roasted garlic, sesame, and hints of acidity. This dish took the flavors of a New York City bagel and cream cheese and delivered the flavor with a much lighter scallion pancake. This dish put my fusion worries to rest and I was excited to taste more Asian American flavor combinations. And it was complimentary so yay!\",\n      \"Next came grilled octopus, served on a bed of pork XO sauce and brown butter with an aerated fingerling potato mash. The octopus was tender and was fantastic when combined with the fragrance of the pork XO and the creaminess of the mash. My weak spot is when the umami of seafood and meat is combined, and this dish delivered. My only complaint is I wanted more octopus and more XO, but onto the next dish!\",\n      \"For our entree, we got the Pig Out For Two, which came with crispy roast Berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodles, side salad, chili sauce, and scallion/ginger sauce. I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying. Each piece comes seasoned with hoisin sauce, but the extra chili and scallion/ginger sauce brighten up the pork.\",\n      \"The side salad came with greens, toasted walnuts, surprisingly lychee, and a sweet dressing.

And finally, the peanut noodles with roasted garlic provided its own nutty, creamy, and spicy flavor that fit with the rest of the dish.\",\n      \"Tuome opened up my perspective and reinstated my belief in fusion cuisine.

A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. \",\n      \"We ordered the butcher’s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.\",\n      \"The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.\",\n      \"The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.\",\n      \"The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn’t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.\",\n      \"We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it’s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.\",\n      \"To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out.

My\n            dad told me stories about growing up in China on rations for rice,\n            protein, and vegetables. One story stands out in particular where\n            his family traded away their cigarette rations for more egg rations\n            to have more protein.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            My mom has always pushed me to think critically about what I eat,\n            quizzing me about what ingredients are behind a certain dish. In our\n            Shanghainese family, the ultimate metric for a dish was the Chinese\n            word 鲜 or xiān. The character 鲜 is made up of the Chinese\n            characters of a fish and lamb, two proteins held in high regard in\n            Chinese cuisine. The best way I can describe it is the deepness in\n            flavor, closest to umami. 鲜 is something we always are chasing when\n            eating, and it’s what separates the best food from the rest.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            I really enjoy traveling and learning about new and different food\n            cultures. I realized recipes we cook today are built on thousands of\n            years of collective human food knowledge. I see documenting\n            delicious meals as a way to share its cultures to a tiny corner of\n            the internet and as a small way to give back to the cultures behind\n            them.\n          </p>\n          <p className={classes.p}>\n            If you made it this far, thanks a lot for reading my ramblings.

landing in Thailand, we got a recommendation from our host to go to the nearby pad thai place AR Simp. Tucked in a small side street nearby a bustling market, AR simp is a true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The dining section is behind a giant outdoor wok setup manned by a Thai grandma and her arsenal of spices. The pad thai here was the best pad thai I\u2019ve had for only 3 USD.","Taking a first bite of the pad thai was like taking a sucker punch to the mouth. The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin. On top of the standard Thai noodle toppings, our plates came with small fried anchovies, fish crackers, pork crackling, and a spicy-sweet green sauce. ","Each element works together, building on top of each other to create the ultimate umami bomb with n factorial flavors in each bite. (n being the number of elements). The crispness of the fish crackers contrasted with the delicate rice noodles.  Some squeezed lime on top cuts through the fattiness of the pork. And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. ","I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a much different experience compared to the pad thai I\u2019ve had in the US.","I\u2019m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand. Our favorite drink was the bael juice, a fruit found in Southeast Asia and India with a mildly sweet, slightly bitter, and extremely refreshing taste.","Their menu had multiple variants of pad thai, with options of additional proteins, egg wrap, and other stir-fries like a radish with a similar flavor profile to the noodles. I wish I had more stomach space to try out more of the other rice plates and noodles here.","We had such a great experience we ended up going 3 times during our stay in Bangkok.

Roselle tasted similar to a hibiscus or flower tea. Bael was mildly sweet and a bit bitter, but super refreshing. You can see in the picture we finished around half of our drinks before the food got to us.","Radish Stir Fry (Chicken) - A fried radish stir fry cooked with similar flavors to the pad thai.

Despite my unrealistic expectations, Supanniga delivered great food at an affordable price. A short walk from the nearby train line along a busy street, Supanniga provided a cozy and lively atmosphere inside. Their menu was a little overwhelming, but each page was filled with descriptive images for each item. Thai curries went for less than 10 USD, half of what they would go for in the US.","The star of our meal was Gaeng Crab Meat Bai Cha Plu, a rich crab curry jam-packed with flavor. The crab is sourced from the province of Surat Thani in Southern Thailand and had an incredibly sweet yet umami flavor. The crab is further amplified by the powerful spices and chilis in the curry. And in return, the curry inherits the deep crab flavor. The curry also came with Cha Plu leaves, which are part of the peppercorn family and counterbalanced the heaviness of the crab.","I also enjoyed Moo Cha Muang, which was pieces of roast pork jammed with a spicy and sweet curry. The pork reminded me of the Chinese recipe of Red Braised Pork , carrying over similar deep flavors of fatty sweet pork. The pork is cooked with Cha Muang leaves, a sour herbal leaf from the Cowa tree from the Eastern coast of Thailand. Once again, I was impressed by the selection of local herbs and ingredients and how each pair with different dishes. My small nitpick is that some pieces were a little tougher than I expected.","At Supanniga, I felt like I was getting a crash course in the best ingredients around Thailand, with the rich proteins and herbs I\u2019ve never heard before.

Inside, Tuome has a pre-war East Village vibe created by its warm candle lighting, exposed brick, and wood finishes all of which add to the coziness of the space. We dined outdoors and were thankful for the heat lamps keeping us warm along and plastic dividers to separate our table.","I\u2019m usually skeptical of fusion food because it often falls short to represent any of the cultures that are being fused. However, my worries were put to rest when I started eating.","We started our meal with scallion pancake puffs with ricotta and everything but the bagel seasoning. I grew up eating a lot of scallion pancake, but this appetizer was unlike what I\u2019ve had before. Each piece was light and air and went well ricotta spread, which tasted like a cream cheese seasoned with roasted garlic, sesame, and hints of acidity. This dish took the flavors of a New York City bagel and cream cheese and delivered the flavor with a much lighter scallion pancake. This dish put my fusion worries to rest and I was excited to taste more Asian American flavor combinations. And it was complimentary so yay!","Next came grilled octopus, served on a bed of pork XO sauce and brown butter with an aerated fingerling potato mash. The octopus was tender and was fantastic when combined with the fragrance of the pork XO and the creaminess of the mash. My weak spot is when the umami of seafood and meat is combined, and this dish delivered. My only complaint is I wanted more octopus and more XO, but onto the next dish!","For our entree, we got the Pig Out For Two, which came with crispy roast Berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodles, side salad, chili sauce, and scallion/ginger sauce. I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome\u2019s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I\u2019ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef\u2019s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying. Each piece comes seasoned with hoisin sauce, but the extra chili and scallion/ginger sauce brighten up the pork.","The side salad came with greens, toasted walnuts, surprisingly lychee, and a sweet dressing. Each element worked well together. The brightness and sweetness from the salad were very welcome with the heaviness of the pork. And finally, the peanut noodles with roasted garlic provided its own nutty, creamy, and spicy flavor that fit with the rest of the dish.","Tuome opened up my perspective and reinstated my belief in fusion cuisine. Western and Eastern elements worked together at Tuome, and each flavor combination was explicit. Every decision was intentional and thoughtful, and I think that this extreme thoughtfulness is represented by the Michelin star rating of the restaurant.","As an Asian American, fusion cuisine is my culture, made up of both Eastern and Western influences.

I was wowed by the food at Cote, but it was the superb service and covid safe setup that took Cote to the next level. ","Cote\u2019s covid measures have been the nicest I\u2019ve seen in a restaurant. We made a reservation for an outdoor cabana, a wooden room that we didn\u2019t have to share with other parties. The cabana could easily fit 4 people and was extremely spacious for our party of 2. Hand sanitizer was provided and we were given a mask bag that we got to keep. A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. ","We ordered the butcher\u2019s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.","The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.","The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.","The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn\u2019t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.","We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it\u2019s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.","To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out. I would say they\u2019re definitely deserving of their Michelin star and I\u2019m happy to say that Cote was the first restaurant I\u2019ve been to with a star!

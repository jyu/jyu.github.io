      "TLDR: Cozy Japanese spot.",
      "I've always walked past Cocoron and it's always been super popular. On their website, it says they are known for 'Juicy Healthy Tasty Heartwarming Food - Made from Scratch'. After trying their food, they delivered on their motto, especially the heartwarming part.",
      "The Karaage was freshly fried and the chicken was super juicy/tender. It tasted great with the kewpie mayo, which added just a bit of acidity and creaminess to the chicken. Unfortunately, the Karaage was not crispy, but I still enjoyed it. ",
      "Cocoron's curry was super unique, with the spice blend and richness making it tasting closer to Indian curries than the Japanese boxed golden curry that I was used to. The roux was super rich that almost made it creamy. The combination of cooked-down chicken and beef broth added a deep meaty flavor. There weren't that many pieces of beef, but the pieces that were there fell apart upon contact. I also wish there were a bit more potatoes/carrots but the curry still went great with the rice by itself. I also got it with a spicy level 4 (Very hot!) and can confirm it had a nice burn.",
      "There was a small Japanese market attached to the restaurant and we had to get some strawberry cream sandwiches, my favorite conbini item from Japan. Of course, it is not comparable in terms of price, but the strawberries were huge and there was more cream than what I've had before. The bread was light and fluffy, and for a moment I was taken back to a 7/11 in Tokyo.",
      "There are so many other soba dishes and donburis at Cocoron that I'd love to try. It's a great spot in the neighborhood and I'd love to go back.",

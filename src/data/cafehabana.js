      "TLDR: Cuban sandwiches are so good.",
      "Cafe Habana is a Cuban restaurant in the heart of Nolita with over 20 years of history. I've never had Cuban food before Cafe Habana and I wished I had discovered Cuban food much earlier because the food is delicious.",
      "They're known for their elote style corn, grilled corn topped with mayo, cotija cheese, paprika, and lime. The praise is well deserved, and I loved the corn's sweetness along with the smokiness coming from its char. The toppings provided a spicy creaminess and just a bit of acidity, adding multiple depths of flavors to the corn. My only nitpick is that I had bits of corn stuck in my teeth but probably because I was eating it too fast lol.",
      "The Cuban sandwich is amazing. The hero bun is perfectly toasted on the grill, encasing layers of ham, swiss cheese, pickles, chipotle mayo, and a giant pile of slow-roasted pork, which flaked apart easily like carnitas. I would have liked to see a bit more fat in the pork, but the fat was well made up for with the creaminess of the cheese/mayo. The bread was toasted perfectly, with its grill marks adding an extra bit of smokiness and a great crunch to contrast the tender pork.",
      "I've also tried the roast pork with rice and beans, but I would recommend the Cuban as a better vehicle for the pork. ",
      "Another plus is that they have great deals on Uber Eats like $10 off any order over $20, making Cafe Habana super value. I enjoyed stuffing my face with pork at Cafe Habana and can't wait to go back in the future.",

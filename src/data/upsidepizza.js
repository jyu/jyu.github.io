      "There's an upside pizza close to my apartment and it's always filled with people whenever I walk by. One late night walking from the train stop back to my place, I succumbed to the allure of Upside Pizza and gave it a shot!",
      "Inside was a super old school tiled pizzeria decor. The staff working there was super nice and was happy to introduce their favorite slices (mushrrom!) and their signature sourdough bread. I opted in for the pepperoni corner slice, and they popped it into the oven to heat up.",
      "I took the pizza to go and was excited to dive into it once I got back. My first impression was that the slice was ginormous up close, not only in the length and width but also in height.",
      "When I took a bite, I first hit by the saltiness and char of the peps. There was a thick layer of cheese, but was unfortunately not melted and a bit chewy. My favorite part of the slice was the bread. It was fluffy like a focaccia with a slight char on the bottom, giving the pizza a crunch in every bite. The sourdough was subtle, and the acidity was welcome in cutting through the saltiness of the pizza. I was surprised that pizza was not as greasy as I expected, and the bread played a big role in making the slice light.",
      "I'm a big fan of tomato sauce on pizza and was looking for it in the slice but failed to find much, potentially due to the fact the slice was dried out from sitting out and reheated. There was also a little too much char for me, with some parts of the crust, peps, and cheese tasting burnt and a bit too bitter for my taste.",
      "Overall, I respected the idea of Upside and their sourdough endeavors, but the reheated slice makes it hard to compare to the other great Sicilian slices in New York. I definitely would want to try a fresh slice right out of the oven, I'm sure that would be delicious. If the night was a little later and I was less sober, I'm sure Upside Pizza would hit the spot.",

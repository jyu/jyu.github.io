      "After landing in Thailand, we got a recommendation from our host to go to the nearby pad thai place AR Simp. Tucked in a small side street nearby a bustling market, AR simp is a true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The dining section is behind a giant outdoor wok setup manned by a Thai grandma and her arsenal of spices. The pad thai here was the best pad thai I’ve had for only 3 USD.",
      "Taking a first bite of the pad thai was like taking a sucker punch to the mouth. The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin. On top of the standard Thai noodle toppings, our plates came with small fried anchovies, fish crackers, pork crackling, and a spicy-sweet green sauce. ",
      "Each element works together, building on top of each other to create the ultimate umami bomb with n factorial flavors in each bite. (n being the number of elements). The crispness of the fish crackers contrasted with the delicate rice noodles.  Some squeezed lime on top cuts through the fattiness of the pork. And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. ",
      "I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a different experience compared to the pad thai I’ve had in the US.",
      "I’m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand. Our favorite drink was the bael juice, a fruit found in Southeast Asia and India with a mildly sweet, slightly bitter, and extremely refreshing taste.",
      "Their menu had multiple variants of pad thai, with options of additional proteins, egg wrap, and other stir-fries like a radish with a similar flavor profile to the noodles. I wish I had more stomach space to try out more of the other rice plates and noodles here.",
      "We had such a great experience we ended up going 3 times during our stay in Bangkok. Would strongly recommend visiting if you ever are in Bangkok. And I can’t wait to go back again.",

      "Pad Thai (pork/shrimp) - See me raving about it above. With $2 for pork and $3 for shrimp, all I can say here is that it’s amazing.",
      "Radish stir fry (chicken) - A fried radish stir fry cooked with similar flavors to the pad thai. Each radish cube was crisp on the outside with a soft inside, making it a surprisingly great vehicle for the spices and flavors in the stir fry.",
      "Pad Thai wrapped in an egg - One of my favorite variations of the pad thai was getting it wrapped in an egg. The presentation is beautiful inside of an egg wrap, and the egg brings everything together even more.",
      "Bael/Roselle Juice - A lifesaver to have when it was 90+ degrees outside in Thailand. Roselle tasted similar to a hibiscus or flower tea. Bael was mildly sweet and a bit bitter, but super refreshing. You can see in the picture we finished around half of our drinks before the food got to us.",

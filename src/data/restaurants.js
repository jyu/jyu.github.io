      "After landing in Thailand, we got a recommendation from our host to go to the nearby pad thai place AR Simp. Tucked in a small side street nearby a bustling market, AR simp is a true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The dining section is behind a giant outdoor wok setup manned by a Thai grandma and her arsenal of spices. The pad thai here was the best pad thai I’ve had for only 3 USD.",
      "Taking a first bite of the pad thai was like taking a sucker punch to the mouth. The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin. On top of the standard Thai noodle toppings, our plates came with small fried anchovies, fish crackers, pork crackling, and a spicy-sweet green sauce. ",
      "Each element works together, building on top of each other to create the ultimate umami bomb with n factorial flavors in each bite. (n being the number of elements). The crispness of the fish crackers contrasted with the delicate rice noodles.  Some squeezed lime on top cuts through the fattiness of the pork. And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. ",
      "I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a much different experience compared to the pad thai I’ve had in the US.",
      "I’m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand. Our favorite drink was the bael juice, a fruit found in Southeast Asia and India with a mildly sweet, slightly bitter, and extremely refreshing taste.",
      "Their menu had multiple variants of pad thai, with options of additional proteins, egg wrap, and other stir-fries like a radish with a similar flavor profile to the noodles. I wish I had more stomach space to try out more of the other rice plates and noodles here.",
      "We had such a great experience we ended up going 3 times during our stay in Bangkok. Would strongly recommend visiting if you ever are in Bangkok. And I can’t wait to go back again.",

Bael was mildly sweet and a bit bitter, but super refreshing. You can see in the picture we finished around half of our drinks before the food got to us.",
      "Radish Stir Fry (Chicken) - A fried radish stir fry cooked with similar flavors to the pad thai. Each radish cube was crisp on the outside with a soft inside, making it a surprisingly great vehicle for the spices and flavors in the stir fry.",

A short walk from the nearby train line along a busy street, Supanniga provided a cozy and lively atmosphere inside. Their menu was a little overwhelming, but each page was filled with descriptive images for each item. Thai curries went for less than 10 USD, half of what they would go for in the US.",
      "The star of our meal was Gaeng Crab Meat Bai Cha Plu, a rich crab curry jam-packed with flavor. The crab is sourced from the province of Surat Thani in Southern Thailand and had an incredibly sweet yet umami flavor. The crab is further amplified by the powerful spices and chilis in the curry. And in return, the curry inherits the deep crab flavor. The curry also came with Cha Plu leaves, which are part of the peppercorn family and counterbalanced the heaviness of the crab.",
      "I also enjoyed Moo Cha Muang, which was pieces of roast pork jammed with a spicy and sweet curry. The pork reminded me of the Chinese recipe of Red Braised Pork , carrying over similar deep flavors of fatty sweet pork. The pork is cooked with Cha Muang leaves, a sour herbal leaf from the Cowa tree from the Eastern coast of Thailand. Once again, I was impressed by the selection of local herbs and ingredients and how each pair with different dishes. My small nitpick is that some pieces were a little tougher than I expected.",

      "Tucked away by Tompkins Square Park, Tuome is a cozy little restaurant founded by Thomas Chen, an Asian American who quit his accountant job to work at Eleven Madison Park and then left to found Tuome. Inside, Tuome has a pre-war East Village vibe created by its warm candle lighting, exposed brick, and wood finishes all of which add to the coziness of the space. We dined outdoors and were thankful for the heat lamps keeping us warm along and plastic dividers to separate our table.",
      "I’m usually skeptical of fusion food because it often falls short to represent any of the cultures that are being fused. However, my worries were put to rest when I started eating.",
      "We started our meal with scallion pancake puffs with ricotta and everything but the bagel seasoning. I grew up eating a lot of scallion pancake, but this appetizer was unlike what I’ve had before. Each piece was light and air and went well ricotta spread, which tasted like a cream cheese seasoned with roasted garlic, sesame, and hints of acidity. This dish took the flavors of a New York City bagel and cream cheese and delivered the flavor with a much lighter scallion pancake. This dish put my fusion worries to rest and I was excited to taste more Asian American flavor combinations. And it was complimentary so yay!",
      "Next came grilled octopus, served on a bed of pork XO sauce and brown butter with an aerated fingerling potato mash. The octopus was tender and was fantastic when combined with the fragrance of the pork XO and the creaminess of the mash. My weak spot is when the umami of seafood and meat is combined, and this dish delivered. My only complaint is I wanted more octopus and more XO, but onto the next dish!",
      "For our entree, we got the Pig Out For Two, which came with crispy roast Berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodles, side salad, chili sauce, and scallion/ginger sauce. I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying. Each piece comes seasoned with hoisin sauce, but the extra chili and scallion/ginger sauce brighten up the pork.",
      "The side salad came with greens, toasted walnuts, surprisingly lychee, and a sweet dressing. Each element worked well together. The brightness and sweetness from the salad were very welcome with the heaviness of the pork. And finally, the peanut noodles with roasted garlic provided its own nutty, creamy, and spicy flavor that fit with the rest of the dish.",
      "Tuome opened up my perspective and reinstated my belief in fusion cuisine. Western and Eastern elements worked together at Tuome, and each flavor combination was explicit. Every decision was intentional and thoughtful, and I think that this extreme thoughtfulness is represented by the Michelin star rating of the restaurant.",

      "A few blocks away from Madison Square Park, Cote is a Korean steakhouse that combines powerful Korean flavors with high-quality cuts of steak. I was wowed by the food at Cote, but it was the superb service and covid safe setup that took Cote to the next level. ",
      "Cote’s covid measures have been the nicest I’ve seen in a restaurant. We made a reservation for an outdoor cabana, a wooden room that we didn’t have to share with other parties. The cabana could easily fit 4 people and was extremely spacious for our party of 2. Hand sanitizer was provided and we were given a mask bag that we got to keep. A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. ",
      "We ordered the butcher’s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.",
      "The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.",
      "The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.",
      "The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn’t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.",
      "We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it’s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.",
      "To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out. I would say they’re definitely deserving of their Michelin star and I’m happy to say that Cote was the first restaurant I’ve been to with a star! Definitely would recommend Cote and excited to come back to try more.",

      "Hawker Chan was the famous hawker that received worldwide fame for his one Michelin star hawker stall known for selling $2 soya sauce chicken rice. Hawker Chan expanded his brand into a few restaurants, and his Chinatown location received a Michelin guide. The story goes that the prices are a dollar more to pay for air conditioning, which was very welcome under the Singapore heat and humidity.",

      "We started with the soya sauce chicken rice, their signature dish. The chicken was juicy and tender and the soy garlic glaze was great on top. The chicken skin added a richness to the dish and was great as the intersection of the sauce and chicken. There was a strong sweetness in the sauce that I didn’t expect and was one of the main flavors that differentiated it from other Chinese barbeque chickens I’ve had in the past.",
      "The barbeque platter came with roast pork (shao rou), Chinese barbeque pork (cha shao), and soya sauce chicken. I’m a big fan of Chinese barbeque and it was great to get quality meats at a cheap price. The roast pork wasn’t particularly crispy, which could be because we went at around 7:30PM at the end of their day. The cha shao was juicy and with a nice char, and was my favorite meat out of the three we had.",
      "Overall, the meats at Hawker Chan’s were done well but were comparable to the Chinese barbeque I’ve had at Chinese supermarkets in the Bay Area. I still enjoyed the food and the intensity of the sauce on the cha shao and soya sauce chicken.

      "Food Loft was part of a food court next to the Allujuned subway station in Singapore. It was a 5 min walk from our Airbnb and we always saw aunties and uncles eating there, so it was only natural for us to try their Singaporean breakfast.",
      "At around $4, we got a soft-boiled egg, kaya toast, and iced coffee. The egg came raw with a pail of boiling water. The auntie there walked us through what time mapped to what consistency on the eggs, and recommended us to try some light soy sauce and pepper on top. The kaya toast came with two pieces of toast with a light coconut jam in the middle. Dipped in the soft-boiled egg and soy sauce, the toast was an incredible combination of sweet, savory, and creaminess.",
      "What tied the breakfast together was the iced coffee, which was a godsend under the Singaporean sun. The caffeine was much needed as we were still a little jetlagged, and the bitterness helped counterbalance the strong flavors of the toast.",
      "Singaporean breakfast isn’t unique to Food Loft, but these ingredients go together so well and is a testament to Singaporean food culture. We went back to Food Loft a couple more times during our stay as it was so convenient for us. On almost every street corner in our neighborhood, we saw food courts and gems like Food Loft inside. And having that availability of great food made Singapore so special for me.",

I’ve written about this in other posts, but the combination of seafood and meat umami is one of my favorite flavor combinations.",

The meat was incredibly tender and juicy. And the umami components of mushroom, parma, jus, and steak blended together to form a deep umami flavor bomb.  Wrapped everything was the many layers of the pastry, soaking up all the meaty flavor and forming the ultimate meat pastry.",

Outside was a ring of fried yam similar to Woo Kok, the fried taro puff served at dim sum. Eating one was a multi-layered experience of textures. The outside was crispy, followed by the creamy layer of yam, and then the perfectly cooked tender scallops.",
      "The chili crab was amazing. The beauty of chili crab lies in its masterful combination of so many multi-cultural flavors that reflect the rich diversity of Singapore. The base was made from Western tomato sauce and a Chinese fermented bean paste. The sauce was powered by an explosion of fragrant Malay and Indian spices: chilies, turmeric, lemongrass, candlenuts, and more. What resulted was a thick, sweet, and spicy umami bomb on top of locally sourced live crab.

We were also given mantou buns to finish up our sauce, and they were very useful in finishing the whole bowl.",

      "TLDR: Upscale Japanese comfort food and one of my favorite fried chickens!",
      'To me, Bessou in one word is "comfy". Inside, the resturant feels like eating at a friend\'s house with light wooden furniture, house plants, bookshelf decor, and chill lofi beats. In terms of covid measures, they had plastic dividers between each table and their front entrace opened up to let in fresh air.',
      "We started off with Agedashi Tofu. Each piece was fried with potato starch and crispy, contrasting the soft tofu inside. The dashi sauce was slightly sweet, but not too salty and went great with the tofu. The tofu also came with dried scallops and when combined with the dashi soy, gave the dish a strong umami taste. The shaved green pepper added a freshness and another element of crisp.",
      "My favorite part of the meal was the Chicken Karaage, which is probably one of the best fried chickens I've had. The chicken was covered in a super crispy shell made from potato starch, and is double fried for extra crunch. The spices on top (paprika, cumin, garlic, gochugaru) were super interesting and brought more of the chicken flavor. The chicken meat was thigh, and was incredibly juicy and tenderness inside. The karaage I've had in Japan used smaller pieces, but Bessou utilized the entire thigh, which I think helped prevent the chicken from being dry. What took the chicken to another level was the yuzu aioli, which added a creamy mayo sauce brightened up with a fresh citrus flavor.  Overall, I was surprised by how light the fried chicken tasted and all the flavors worked together well to make the chicken shine. And the pickle cauliflower on the side was delicous with a perfect level of sweetness and acidity.",
      "I was decently filled with the amount of food we already had, but next came the Tuna Tataki Handroll Platter. I was a little disappointed with the amount of tuna, but the quality of the fish and the fish roe definitely made up for it. The crisp nori and the sushi rice were great supporting ingredients in bringing out the freshness of the seared tuna and roe. The slightly acidicidity in the shiso verde sauce was great with the fish. And the sauce reminded me of a tomatillo based Mexican salsa verde.",
      "Overall, I loved Bessou's excellent use of high quality ingredients and traditional Japanese techniques that made the food taste amazing. Bessou in Japanese means home away from home, and I definitely felt that cozy homey atmosphere through the food at Bessou.",

      "I started with the Adobada Taco with a corn tortilla. The marinade on the pork was great, with a strong blend of spices and chilies. There was a ton of adobada in the taco and the pork was flavorful and juicy. The savory pork was balanced by the fresh toppings of sweet pineapple, radish, onions, and cilantro. The tacos also came with some dried chili peppers that added some much-appreciated heat. The tortillas also were slightly charred and made the corn tortilla more fragrant. It could be because of the delivery, but I didn't taste any charred bits of the pork or any fatty parts of the Adobada.",

      "Overall, the meats and their flavors were high quality at Los Tacos but were missing some of the great taco meat flavors I was looking for in a great taco while being more expensive. It satisfied my craving for Mexican food and I would get their Adobada again, but this time in person.",

You pay $2.50 for each taco inside and bring it outside for some freshly made tacos! I've been to Las Palmas at least 10 times and it satisfies my Mexican food craving.",

      "One of my favorite meats is the chorizo, a spiced ground sausage that's packed with flavor and slightly greasy. The steak is also tender and flavorful, with a char from the grill. The carnitas is amazingly tender and falls apart like pulled pork, but with fatty bits interspersed. I also really like the fajitas, with its mix of flavorful falling apart peppers, tender pieces of pork, and cheese. I've also tried their meats like chicken, barbacoa, and more, and all of them have been delicious.",
      "The final part of the taco is the topping bar. There are all sorts of fresh salsas, with my favorite being the salsa verde with its creamy avocado and fresh tomatillo blend. They also have pico de gallo, a SUPER spicy orange salsa, and a few others. The fresh toppings of onions, cilantro, and lime also help bring lightness to a heavy taco and complete the taco experience. My only complaint is that I've noticed the cilantro not be fresh towards the end of the day with black spots, so be careful!",

      "My main order would be the carne asada (steak), al pastor (marinated pork with onions), and carnitas (slow-cooked pulled pork). All the meats are freshly made, tender, juicy, and flavorful. The beans help add a layer of creaminess to the taco and the salsa brings in acidity and freshness that lifts up the taco. I loved drenching my tacos in additional salsa verde, with its bright tomatillo flavor. Their orange salsa also had this unique smokiness and spiciness that brought another flavor dimension to the tacos.",

      "La Tacqueria lies at the heart of the Mission district. Both the outside and inside are packed with customers, and the line to order snakes around the entire restaurant.",
      "Jumping into the burrito, the meat to get at La Tacqueria is carne asada, freshly grilled pieces of marinated steak. The slight char on the carne asada adds a smokiness to the meat, and each piece is extremely tender. Accompanying the meat are the pinto beans that pop with flavor and add a creaminess to the burrito. Not to be outdone, avocado, sour cream, and cheese also add more layers of fat and flavor. What cuts through all the heaviness is the pico de gallo, with fresh pieces of tomatoes, onion, cilantro, and lime. The salsa verde on the side also has a deep roasted tomatillo flavor and brings some much-needed spice to the burrito. The owner has a strong preference that rice doesn't belong in burritos, and I have to agree when the lack of rice makes more room for so many of the other high-quality ingredients inside. ",
      "What brings the burrito together is the flour tortilla. An important tip for ordering is to ask for the burrito grilled, which transforms the tortilla into a crispy golden shell. The outer layers of the tortilla add an element of crunch, while the inner layers are soft and steamed. The tortilla is the perfect delivery mechanism for everything inside.",
      "What makes La Tacqueria special is that each ingredient stands out on its own, and the union of everything together is perfectly balanced and truly amazing.

      "TLDR: Best pizza.",
      "Whenever I land in NYC, I start craving New York pizza. And the best is at Rubirosa Ristorante, an amazing Italian restaurant nestled in Nolita. Inside has a cozy Italian home vibe, but I've only dined outside. They have a great covid setup, complete with wood booths, heat lamps above, hand sanitizers, and plastic dividers. ",
      "When I think of Rubirosa, what comes to mind is their tomato sauce. They're able to get a deep umami flavor out of their tomatoes, making the sauce almost taste meaty but without any meat. At the same time, the acidity and the sweetness from the tomatoes bring brightness to anything the sauce touches.",
      "An essential starter to Rubirosa is the calamari. The squid is lightly fried, with the crust almost flaking off but also providing an amazing crunch. The squid itself is tender and goes great with the lemon and chopped basil on top. The real magic is when the calamari is dipped in the tomato sauce, joining the umami of the squid and tomatoes along with the acidity from the lemon and the sauce. The sauce fills all the crevices of the breading and creates a tomato sauce gusher that explodes with flavor. The sauce also has a slight spicy kick, adding another dimension of flavor. A pro-tip is to ask for more sauce after you finish! We usually finish the sauce halfway through the calamari because it's so good.",
      "The pizza at Rubirosa is one of a kind, best enjoyed piping hot right out of the oven. The pizza has an insanely crispy crust that has almost a cracker-like texture, and the crust's slight char adds a smoky dimension to the pizza. The crunchy-ness of the crust contrasts the melty fresh mozzarella on top and is the perfect delivery vehicle for the tomato sauce. Their cheese is milky and has its own slightly chewy texture, bringing together the tomato and the crust. Enjoying it right way ensures the maximum crispness of the crust, meltiness of the cheese, and flavors of the tomato sauce. And it's worth it burning the roof of my mouth over.",
      "The foundation of the pizza is already delicious, but the toppings bring it to another level. The move is definitely to get half and half of two pizzas to try more flavors.",
      "My favorite flavor is the Rubirosa Supreme, with mini meatballs, roasted garlic, pepperoni, and chopped basil. Even though I love meat on pizza, the best part for me is the roast garlic. The garlic is roasted until it's super soft, and it melts almost like garlic butter. Even though it's a clove of garlic, the garlic flavors are muted and not overwhemling. It adds a layer of creaminess and flavor that ties together the meat, tomatoes, cheese, and crust. The meats themselves are flavorful and high quality, as shown by the pepperonis curling into tiny cups.",
      "I've been to Rubirosa probably around 5 times and I probably could make an album on my phone for it. The first time I had Rubirosa was delivery, which was average and the flavors were muted. So definitely go in person, having the pizza right away is the way to go!",

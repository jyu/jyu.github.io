      "After landing in Thailand, we got a recommendation from our host to go to the nearby pad thai place AR Simp. Tucked in a small side street nearby a bustling market, AR simp is a true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The dining section is behind a giant outdoor wok setup manned by a Thai grandma and her arsenal of spices. The pad thai here was the best pad thai I’ve had for only 3 USD.",
      "Taking a first bite of the pad thai was like taking a sucker punch to the mouth. The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin. On top of the standard Thai noodle toppings, our plates came with small fried anchovies, fish crackers, pork crackling, and a spicy-sweet green sauce. ",
      "Each element works together, building on top of each other to create the ultimate umami bomb with n factorial flavors in each bite. (n being the number of elements). The crispness of the fish crackers contrasted with the delicate rice noodles.  Some squeezed lime on top cuts through the fattiness of the pork. And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. ",
      "I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a much different experience compared to the pad thai I’ve had in the US.",
      "I’m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand. Our favorite drink was the bael juice, a fruit found in Southeast Asia and India with a mildly sweet, slightly bitter, and extremely refreshing taste.",
      "Their menu had multiple variants of pad thai, with options of additional proteins, egg wrap, and other stir-fries like a radish with a similar flavor profile to the noodles. I wish I had more stomach space to try out more of the other rice plates and noodles here.",
      "We had such a great experience we ended up going 3 times during our stay in Bangkok. Would strongly recommend visiting if you ever are in Bangkok. And I can’t wait to go back again.",

      "★ Pad Thai Wrapped in Egg ($3) - One of my favorite variations of the pad thai was getting it wrapped in an egg. The presentation is beautiful inside of an egg wrap, and the egg brings everything together even more.",
      "★ Bael/Roselle Juice (<$1)- A lifesaver to have when it was 90+ degrees outside in Thailand. Roselle tasted similar to a hibiscus or flower tea. Bael was mildly sweet and a bit bitter, but super refreshing. You can see in the picture we finished around half of our drinks before the food got to us.",
      "Radish Stir Fry (Chicken) - A fried radish stir fry cooked with similar flavors to the pad thai. Each radish cube was crisp on the outside with a soft inside, making it a surprisingly great vehicle for the spices and flavors in the stir fry.",

      "Supanniga was the first Michelin guide restaurant I’ve been to. Despite my unrealistic expectations, Supanniga delivered great food at an affordable price. A short walk from the nearby train line along a busy street, Supanniga provided a cozy and lively atmosphere inside. Their menu was a little overwhelming, but each page was filled with descriptive images for each item. Thai curries went for less than 10 USD, half of what they would go for in the US.",
      "The star of our meal was Gaeng Crab Meat Bai Cha Plu, a rich crab curry jam-packed with flavor. The crab is sourced from the province of Surat Thani in Southern Thailand and had an incredibly sweet yet umami flavor. The crab is further amplified by the powerful spices and chilis in the curry. And in return, the curry inherits the deep crab flavor. The curry also came with Cha Plu leaves, which are part of the peppercorn family and counterbalanced the heaviness of the crab.",
      "I also enjoyed Moo Cha Muang, which was pieces of roast pork jammed with a spicy and sweet curry. The pork reminded me of the Chinese recipe of Red Braised Pork , carrying over similar deep flavors of fatty sweet pork. The pork is cooked with Cha Muang leaves, a sour herbal leaf from the Cowa tree from the Eastern coast of Thailand. Once again, I was impressed by the selection of local herbs and ingredients and how each pair with different dishes. My small nitpick is that some pieces were a little tougher than I expected.",
      "At Supanniga, I felt like I was getting a crash course in the best ingredients around Thailand, with the rich proteins and herbs I’ve never heard before. I learned a lot and it was a treat to enjoy the chef’s wealth of knowledge around the local ingredients of Thailand.",

      "Tucked away by Tompkins Square Park, Tuome is a cozy little restaurant founded by Thomas Chen, an Asian American who quit his accountant job to work at Eleven Madison Park and then left to found Tuome. Inside, Tuome has a pre-war East Village vibe created by its warm candle lighting, exposed brick, and wood finishes all of which add to the coziness of the space. We dined outdoors and were thankful for the heat lamps keeping us warm along and plastic dividers to separate our table.",
      "I’m usually skeptical of fusion food because it often falls short to represent any of the cultures that are being fused. However, my worries were put to rest when I started eating.",
      "We started our meal with scallion pancake puffs with ricotta and everything but the bagel seasoning. I grew up eating a lot of scallion pancake, but this appetizer was unlike what I’ve had before. Each piece was light and air and went well ricotta spread, which tasted like a cream cheese seasoned with roasted garlic, sesame, and hints of acidity. This dish took the flavors of a New York City bagel and cream cheese and delivered the flavor with a much lighter scallion pancake. This dish put my fusion worries to rest and I was excited to taste more Asian American flavor combinations. And it was complimentary so yay!",
      "Next came grilled octopus, served on a bed of pork XO sauce and brown butter with an aerated fingerling potato mash. The octopus was tender and was fantastic when combined with the fragrance of the pork XO and the creaminess of the mash. My weak spot is when the umami of seafood and meat is combined, and this dish delivered. My only complaint is I wanted more octopus and more XO, but onto the next dish!",
      "For our entree, we got the Pig Out For Two, which came with crispy roast Berkshire pork, spicy peanut noodles, side salad, chili sauce, and scallion/ginger sauce. I love crispy roast pork, and wow this was amazing. After biting into a piece, I was first hit with the crispiness of the skin, the signature part of roast pork. Tuome’s rendition was crispier than any other roast pork I’ve had, potentially due to the freshness of the dish and chef’s Western techniques (blowtorch?). The next wave of flavor was the pork itself, which falls apart upon contact. And finally comes the richness of the pork, making each bite more satisfying. Each piece comes seasoned with hoisin sauce, but the extra chili and scallion/ginger sauce brighten up the pork.",
      "The side salad came with greens, toasted walnuts, surprisingly lychee, and a sweet dressing. Each element worked well together. The brightness and sweetness from the salad were very welcome with the heaviness of the pork. And finally, the peanut noodles with roasted garlic provided its own nutty, creamy, and spicy flavor that fit with the rest of the dish.",
      "Tuome opened up my perspective and reinstated my belief in fusion cuisine. Western and Eastern elements worked together at Tuome, and each flavor combination was explicit. Every decision was intentional and thoughtful, and I think that this extreme thoughtfulness is represented by the Michelin star rating of the restaurant.",
      "As an Asian American, fusion cuisine is my culture, made up of both Eastern and Western influences. And eating some of my favorite childhood foods combined with modern Western techniques made the food at Tuome resonate for me.",

      "Cote is the best KBBQ in New York City.",
      "A few blocks away from Madison Square Park, Cote is a Korean steakhouse that combines powerful Korean flavors with high-quality cuts of steak. I was wowed by the food at Cote, but it was the superb service and covid safe setup that took Cote to the next level. ",
      "Cote’s covid measures have been the nicest I’ve seen in a restaurant. We made a reservation for an outdoor cabana, a wooden room that we didn’t have to share with other parties. The cabana could easily fit 4 people and was extremely spacious for our party of 2. Hand sanitizer was provided and we were given a mask bag that we got to keep. A big bonus of the cabana was that there were heat lamps under the table that kept us warm. ",
      "We ordered the butcher’s feast, which was $54 per person and came with a selection of 4 cuts of meats, banchan, 2 soups, an omelet, and a cup of soft serve.",
      "The first two cuts that came were Prime Hanger Steak and Prime Dry-Age Ribeye. The steaks were incredibly tender and the fat in each piece melted in my mouth. The meat was cooked perfectly and I could taste the quality with each piece. My favorite condiment paired with the meat was the ssamjang fermented bean paste. Their saamjang was packed with flavor, joining together the umami from the bean paste, spiciness from the chilis, fragrance from sesame and scallions, and sweetness. I wish I could buy a jar of that ssamjang to eat with anything, but it was the perfect pairing with the meat.",
      "The star of the meal for me was the banchan. We got a huge selection of banchan side dishes that provided the perfect level of acidity to accompany the meat. We were served a scallion salad with gochujang vinaigrette, pickled cauliflower, kimchi, pickled radish, marinated perilla leaves, and lettuce. My favorites were the cauliflower, scallion salad, and kimchi, all of which brought a freshness that cuts through the heaviness of the meat. Combining meat and pickles is a classic combination, but Cote executed that concept perfectly with the high quality of meats and their refined take on Korean banchan classics.",
      "The next two cuts were American Wagyu and Prime Marinated Short Rib (Galbi). The wagyu was tender but not quite as much as Japanese Wagyu, which is to be expected. The galbi was interesting in that it came in thick pieces like a steak rather than the traditional thin-cut galbi at Korean barbeque. I was surprised that it didn’t have the fall in the apart feeling as I expected, but was fantastic as a cut of steak.",
      "We also got a kimchi stew, dwen-jang stew, and egg souffle. Usually, I feel like it’s a crime to have kimchi soup at AYCE KBBQ places (too much stomach space!), but it was a joy to enjoy the deep umami flavors of the soup with rice and meat. The egg souffle with kelp reminded me of a dish I grew up eating: steamed egg with dried shrimp.",
      "To finish off the meal, we had soft serve with caramel drizzled on top that was a great way to end our meal. Usually, 'high-end' restaurants serve tiny bits of food, but I was very glad to be satisfied after our meal at Cote. I enjoyed Cote because of their holistic approach to the meal. Every part from the service, outdoor dining setup, cut of meat, dry aging method, ssamjang flavoring, and the kimchi acidity worked together beautifully, and I could tell that each component was meticulously thought out. I would say they’re definitely deserving of their Michelin star and I’m happy to say that Cote was the first restaurant I’ve been to with a star! Definitely would recommend Cote and excited to come back to try more.",

      "Hawker Chan was the famous hawker that received worldwide fame for his one Michelin star hawker stall known for selling $2 soya sauce chicken rice. Hawker Chan expanded his brand into a few restaurants, and his Chinatown location received a Michelin guide. The story goes that the prices are a dollar more to pay for air conditioning, which was very welcome under the Singapore heat and humidity.",
      "We visited Hawker Chan’s restaurant on the day we arrived in Singapore. The prices were cheap and the food was delicious.",
      "We started with the soya sauce chicken rice, their signature dish. The chicken was juicy and tender and the soy garlic glaze was great on top. The chicken skin added a richness to the dish and was great as the intersection of the sauce and chicken. There was a strong sweetness in the sauce that I didn’t expect and was one of the main flavors that differentiated it from other Chinese barbeque chickens I’ve had in the past.",
      "The barbeque platter came with roast pork (shao rou), Chinese barbeque pork (cha shao), and soya sauce chicken. I’m a big fan of Chinese barbeque and it was great to get quality meats at a cheap price. The roast pork wasn’t particularly crispy, which could be because we went at around 7:30PM at the end of their day. The cha shao was juicy and with a nice char, and was my favorite meat out of the three we had.",
      "Overall, the meats at Hawker Chan’s were done well but were comparable to the Chinese barbeque I’ve had at Chinese supermarkets in the Bay Area. I still enjoyed the food and the intensity of the sauce on the cha shao and soya sauce chicken. I’m glad to have paid the legendary Michelin star hawker a visit, and it set the tone for visiting many more hawkers and food stalls in Singapore.",

      "Singaporean breakfast at Food Loft is so simple and so perfect.",
      "Food Loft was part of a food court next to the Allujuned subway station in Singapore. It was a 5 min walk from our Airbnb and we always saw aunties and uncles eating there, so it was only natural for us to try their Singaporean breakfast.",
      "At around $4, we got a soft-boiled egg, kaya toast, and iced coffee. The egg came raw with a pail of boiling water. The auntie there walked us through what time mapped to what consistency on the eggs, and recommended us to try some light soy sauce and pepper on top. The kaya toast came with two pieces of toast with a light coconut jam in the middle. Dipped in the soft-boiled egg and soy sauce, the toast was an incredible combination of sweet, savory, and creaminess.",
      "What tied the breakfast together was the iced coffee, which was a godsend under the Singaporean sun. The caffeine was much needed as we were still a little jetlagged, and the bitterness helped counterbalance the strong flavors of the toast.",
      "Singaporean breakfast isn’t unique to Food Loft, but these ingredients go together so well and is a testament to Singaporean food culture. We went back to Food Loft a couple more times during our stay as it was so convenient for us. On almost every street corner in our neighborhood, we saw food courts and gems like Food Loft inside. And having that availability of great food made Singapore so special for me.",
      "Also, there are many more lunch and dinner options at Food Loft, but we didn't have time to try them. I'll have to come back!",

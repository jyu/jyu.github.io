      "After landing in Thailand, we got a recommendation from our host to go to the nearby pad thai place AR Simp. Tucked in a small side street nearby a bustling market, AR simp is a true hole-in-the-wall restaurant. The dining section is behind a giant outdoor wok setup manned by a Thai grandma and her arsenal of spices. The pad thai here was the best pad thai I’ve had for only 3 USD.",
      "Taking a first bite of the pad thai was like taking a sucker punch to the mouth. The noodles were spicy, sour, sweet, savory, and fragrant. Each noodle dish came with a selection of chicken,  shrimp, or roast pork with crispy skin. On top of the standard Thai noodle toppings, our plates came with small fried anchovies, fish crackers, pork crackling, and a spicy-sweet green sauce. ",
      "Each element works together, building on top of each other to create the ultimate umami bomb with n factorial flavors in each bite. (n being the number of elements). The crispness of the fish crackers contrasted with the delicate rice noodles.  Some squeezed lime on top cuts through the fattiness of the pork. And fresh cilantro, bean sprouts, scallions bring an element of freshness that lifts the dish. ",
      "I wish I knew what dark magic combination of spices and aromatics were used in the noodles, but having so many types of proteins built the flavor base and led to a different experience compared to the pad thai I’ve had in the US.",
      "I’m usually not a big fan of sweet drinks, but the iced juices were perfect with the noodles on a 90+ degree day in Thailand. Our favorite drink was the bael juice, a fruit found in Southeast Asia and India with a mildly sweet, slightly bitter, and extremely refreshing taste.",
      "Their menu had multiple variants of pad thai, with options of additional proteins, egg wrap, and other stir-fries like a radish with a similar flavor profile to the noodles. I wish I had more stomach space to try out more of the other rice plates and noodles here.",
      "We had such a great experience we ended up going 3 times during our stay in Bangkok. Would strongly recommend visiting if you ever are in Bangkok. And I can’t wait to go back again.",

      "★ Pad Thai (Roast Pork/Shrimp) - See me raving about it above. With $2 for pork and $3 for shrimp, all I can say here is that it’s amazing.",
      "★ Pad Thai Wrapped in Egg - One of my favorite variations of the pad thai was getting it wrapped in an egg. The presentation is beautiful inside of an egg wrap, and the egg brings everything together even more.",
      "★ Bael/Roselle Juice - A lifesaver to have when it was 90+ degrees outside in Thailand. Roselle tasted similar to a hibiscus or flower tea. Bael was mildly sweet and a bit bitter, but super refreshing. You can see in the picture we finished around half of our drinks before the food got to us.",
      "Radish Stir Fry (Chicken) - A fried radish stir fry cooked with similar flavors to the pad thai. Each radish cube was crisp on the outside with a soft inside, making it a surprisingly great vehicle for the spices and flavors in the stir fry.",

      "Supanniga was the first Michelin guide restaurant I’ve been to. Despite my unrealistic expectations, Supanniga delivered great food at an affordable price. A short walk from the nearby train line along a busy street, Supanniga provided a cozy and lively atmosphere inside. Their menu was huge, but each page was filled with giant images for each item, one of my favorite parts of Asian restaurants. Thai curries went for less than 10 USD, half of what they would go for in the US.",
      "The star of our meal was “Gaeng Crab Meat Bai Cha Plu”, a rich crab curry jam-packed with flavor. The crab is sourced from the province of Surat Thani in Southern Thailand and had an incredibly sweet yet umami flavor. The crab is further amplified by the powerful spices and chilis in the curry. And in return, the curry inherits the deep crab flavor. The curry also came with Cha Plu leaves, which are usually used in wraps and part of the peppercorn family. The Cha Plu brought an element of freshness that counterbalances the heaviness of the crab.",
      "I also really enjoyed “Moo Cha Muang”, with pieces of roast pork jammed with a spicy and sweet curry. The pork reminded me of the Chinese recipe of “Red Braised Pork Belly”, carrying over similar deep flavors of fatty sweet pork. The pork is cooked with Cha Muang leaves, a sour herbal leaf from the Cowa tree from the Eastern coast of Thailand. Once again, I was impressed by the selection of local herbs and ingredients and how each pair with different dishes. My small nitpick is that some pieces were a little tougher, but overall was enjoyable.",
      "At Supanniga, I felt like I was getting a crash course in the best ingredients around Thailand, with the rich proteins and herbs I’ve never heard before. I learned a lot and it was a treat to enjoy the chef’s wealth of knowledge around the local ingredients of Thailand.",

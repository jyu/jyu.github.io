      "TLDR: Sandwiches very yum",
      "We stumbled upon Foxface walking to another lunch spot in East Village. The bold fox logo caught my eye, and the entire restaurant and kitchen was in a tiny window room. I was drawn in by the array of signs describing all sorts of meat sandwiches plastered around the window, and I knew I had to try it.",
      "The lady we ordered from was super nice and reminded me of a lunch lady describing our sandwiches and packing in extra napkins for us in our takeout box. The walk back to my apartment was grueling, but the wait was worth it.",
      "The Smoking Fox is their signature sandwich and was delicious. The meat was smoky and flaked upon contact. The slaw was light and refreshing, and the pickles and sauce added an extra sour and spicy kick. The breading was perfectly toasted with a crunch crust and fluffy bread inside. My only minor nitpick was that I wanted more meat, and I will get double meat next time I go!",
      "I expected Getting Cheeky to have higher variance due to the difficulty of cooking beef cheek, but this sandwich was a home run. The filling inside tasted like a beef stew from a fancy restaurant, with the beef cheek cooked perfectly tender and absorbing all of the deep umami demiglace reduction sauce. My favorite part was the gelatinous tendon-like parts that added new textures to the meat. The caramelized onions and roasted carrots also provided a sweetness to uplift the sandwich. Finally, the bread soaked up all of the sauce and bits of stew, making it a fantastic vehicle for delivering the stew.",

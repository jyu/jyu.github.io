      "TLDR: Great aesthetics, okay food.",
      "I have to say that Casa La Femme is a beautiful restaurant. The tables and furniture are plated in gold. The chairs have intricate patterns and are the cushions are huge. There are a ton of flowers and plants that make it feel like eating in the middle of a tropical garden.",
      "This is a food blog and I do need to talk about the food. The food tasted fine, but the portions were small and were overpriced. The lamb kebob platter had 3 lamb kebobs on a plate of arugula with some tahini and pickles. There wasn't that much lamb, but it was well spiced. I did like the sesame pita and the dish overall, I just didn't think it was worth $22 and was hungry afterward. ",
      "The other members of our party were also still hungry, so we shared a vegetarian flatbread. It had arugula with layers of beans and pickles on top of a flatbread. The flatbread tasted fine.",
      "I respect the level of detail put into by Casa La Femme, but the food tasted okay. I would recommend it if you are trying to take pictures, but I wouldn't recommend it for food.",
